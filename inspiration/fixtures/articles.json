    "introduction": "Rik Duijm lived for nearly 10 years in the Peruvian Andes. Braving severe altitudes, packs of aggressive stray dogs and extreme climates he explored several magnificent long distance trails near tourist hotspot Cusco. Glaciers, cloud forest and everything in between. A must for every adventure travel junkie.",
    "content_one": "Cusco is a mayor destination in South America. It's the place from where tours to Machu Picchu, the \"Lost City of the Inca's\", start. Many people choose to hike the world famous Inca Trail, a four days trek or the alternative Salkantay Trek. Both are renowned for it's beauty and for the enormous variation in landscapes. The Inca Trail is just a marathon, only 42 kilometers long. However, you climb towards an altitude of over 4200 meters above sea level - bare rocks, glaciers, and few animals besides herds of alpacas and llamas and sometimes a condor - before descending into the lush upper cloud forest, coffee, tea and fruit plantages, parakeets and hummingbirds.\r\n\r\nCan a route be even more beautiful and alternating than this? Yes, of course!",

It's where I'm free, it's where I am happy.\r\n\r\nThe hardest marathon in the Netherlands - the Kust Marathon - takes place here in October. During the entire marathon you run along the shore, for about 13 kilometers on the beach and 10 kilometers in the dunes.
